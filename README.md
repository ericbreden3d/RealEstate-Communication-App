This system is a set of two native Android applications intended to streamline communcation and understanding between Real Estate agents and their clients.

It does so by affording Agents the ability to quickly update all people involved with the buying/selling of any give property at once, keeping all parties on the same page in real time. Agents will also be able to create modular Events that will appear in the Clients' version of the app.

Both versions of the app will include a Questions section where Clients can get their questions answered in a format similar to popular websites like Quora and Piazza. When users ask a question, their agent will be notified by means of a push notificatin. When they respond, all involved parties will be notified as well, and they will be able to comment and ask follow-up questions.

The Client version of the app also includes a Roadmap section. It is primarily informative and includes a list of clickable "Milestones" that each relate to steps in the home buying/selling process that need to be completed. Clicking on any Milestone will open an informational page containing a video, synopsis, and FAQ. This section will also feature a progress system whereby an agent can mark a step as completed through their version of the app.

The applications are currently under development, and only specific features are functional at this time. The project will also be portred to iOS at later date.
